# Pharm-ate
Your AI-powered pharmacy and diagnostic companion.
# Problem Statement
Pharmacies and healthcare systems often face inefficiencies in prescription management, medicine recommendations, and specialist referrals, leading to delays and errors in patient care. Additionally, children, elderly, and illiterate patients struggle to find the right specialist, while doctor unavailability can cause further delays.

PharmAssist AI aims to solve these challenges by:

--> Automatically matching handwritten prescriptions to medicines.

--> Recommending specialists based on symptoms and patient history.

--> Providing safe medicine recommendations for minor illnesses.

--> Ensuring accessibility for illiterate, elderly, and disabled patients.

--> Handling doctor unavailability by suggesting online consultations.

--> Offering AI-powered drug safety checks and dosage reminders.

--> Tracking patient history for personalized recommendations and safety (from allergies, past prescriptions ).

# Key Features & Approach

âœ… Prescription Matching & Order Creation â€“

Uses OCR & NLP to extract handwritten prescriptions and generate medicine orders.

âœ… Specialist Recommendation â€“

AI-based symptom analysis to suggest the right doctor, with voice input for accessibility.

âœ… Doctor Availability & Telemedicine â€“

Checks real-time doctor availability and suggests online consultations if unavailable.

âœ… AI-Driven Medicine Suggestions â€“

Provides OTC medicine recommendations, checks drug interactions, and sets dosage reminders.

âœ… History Tracking & Personalized Care â€“ 

Stores patient history for smart recommendations and alerts for medication conflicts.

âœ… Smart UI & Multilingual Support â€“ 

Supports voice-based interactions, image input, and multiple languages for easy access.
